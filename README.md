# Gigs4You
In this project, I wanted to build an application to quickly and easily view the concerts that will take place near me. 
I have put into practice my skills in layout, design, and Javascript. I have used Ticketmasters API to bring all the music info, dates, prices, venues... If you
want to create a project similar to mine, you have to register to get an API key.
